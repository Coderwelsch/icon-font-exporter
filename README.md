# Icon Font Exporter

Plugin that lets you export your designed icons to a web icon font. 
Psstâ€¦ Itâ€™s developer friendly! You can define `.sketchconfig.json` files for each Sketch project ðŸ˜‰ â€¦  

## Installation

- [Download](../../releases/latest/download/icon-font-exporter.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on icon-font-exporter.sketchplugin

## Using `.sketchconfig.json` Configuration

You can create a `.sketchconfig.json` file in the same directory as your sketch mockup, if you want to store and adjust the behaviour of the plugin. Currently it is limited to some basic options.

Folder Structure:
- `YourDesigns.sketch`
- `.sketchconfig.json`

### Example `.sketchconfig.json` config:

```js
{
    "plugins": {
        "icon-font-exporter": { // selector/name of the plugin (itâ€™s like a namespaces
            "pageName": "Icons", // name of the page in Sketch containing your icon artboards
            "output": "/Users/YOUR_USER/your_website.com/src/webfonts/" // Output folder (example)
        }
    }
}
```
